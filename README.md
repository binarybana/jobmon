## JobMon

JobMon is a distributed job manager designed to ease the process of running 
parallel simulations on heterogenous computing infrastructure (groups of 
clusters and workstations). 

## Building Blocks

This software would not be possible without the following components:
- Python for the main driving and glue code
- [Redis](http://redis.io) for the distributed job management
- rsyslog for remote logging

## Redis Schema

The Redis schema we are using for this is:

- jobs:new
- jobs:working
- jobs:done

The first two are lists of job source hashes, and jobs:done is a key of the 
number of done jobs.

- jobs:done:<hash>
The list containing the completed job results. For sweep jobs the hash will be 
<hash>-<p> where p was the parameter for that run.

- jobs:sources
A hashmap from job hash to gzipped source text.

- jobs:sweepconfigs 
A hashmap from a job hash to a string of space separated values that the sweep 
was run with.

- workers:hbs
A sorted hashmap of heartbeat times to json encoded info about the child. (See 
next section)

- workers:stop
A key to indicate that the workers should stop.


## Heartbeat Schema
 
The heartbeats that the children will send back have yet to be defined, but the 
JSON will probably include:
- unique_id: as generated by the child
- status: text describing current state (working, resting)
- history: time at that state (seconds)
- job: if working, what job? (if resting, then blank)
