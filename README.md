## JobMon

JobMon is a distributed job manager designed to ease the process of running 
parallel simulations on heterogenous computing infrastructure (groups of 
clusters and workstations). 

## Building Blocks

This software would not be possible without the following components:
- Python for the main driving and glue code
- [Redis](http://redis.io) for the distributed job management
- rsyslog for remote logging
